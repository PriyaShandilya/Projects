                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Poaching is a serious threat to the survival of many species of animals. It is the illegal hunting,
                    killing, or capturing of wild animals, often for commercial gain. Poaching has been a problem for
                    many
                    years, and it continues to be a major issue today. Poaching not only threatens the survival of
                    animals, but it also has negative effects on the environment and the economy.</p>

                <h2>Poaching Detection</h2>
                <p>Poaching detection is the use of technology to detect and prevent poaching. One of the most effective
                    tools for poaching detection is machine learning. Machine learning is a type of artificial
                    intelligence that allows computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly
                    programmed.</p>

                <h2>Effects of Poaching</h2>
                <p>Poaching has several negative effects on the environment, the economy, and society as a whole. Some
                    of the
                    effects of poaching include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Loss of biodiversity: Poaching can lead to the extinction of certain species of animals, which
                        can
                        have a negative impact on the environment as a whole.
                    </li>
                    <li>Disruption of ecosystems: The loss of certain species of animals can disrupt ecosystems and
                        affect the
                        balance of nature.
                    </li>
                    <li>Loss of revenue: Poaching can negatively impact the tourism industry, which is often dependent
                        on the
                        presence of wildlife.
                    </li>
                    <li>Increased crime: Poaching is often associated with other forms of crime, such as smuggling and
                        money
                        laundering.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>Poaching is a serious threat to the survival of many species of animals. It is important to use all
                    available
                    tools and technologies to prevent and detect poaching. This web application is just one example
